/**
 * When the client asks CRCE for data about replacement bundle versions and
 * provides identifier of a bundle version b_i which exists in the repository
 * and optionally provides a desired operation(op).
 *
 * Then CRCE sends a set of meta-data (the "core" part) of those bundle versions
 * b_r which are strictly compatible with b_i and have same provider, name as
 * b_i and optionally satisfy the operation or replies
 * "no such version found in repository".
 *
 * Note: The operation value can be
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>upgrade [default] = b_r must have same provider, name as b_i and higher
 * version than b_i </li>
 * <li>nearest = metadata of a single bundle which has lowest r > i </li>
 * <li>highest = metadata of a single bundle which has highest r > i  </li>
 * <li>downgrade = b_r must have same provider, name as b_i and lower version than b_i  </li>
 * <li>any = b_r must have same provider, name as b_i and version of b_r
 * is different to that of b_i </li>
 * </ul>
